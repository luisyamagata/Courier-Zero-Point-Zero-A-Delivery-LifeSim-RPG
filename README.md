# Courier Zero point Zero - a Delivery-LifeSim RPG game
A repostiory for a game for the itch.io - Accountability Jam: November 2025

Obs: This repository, was created in october for the October 2025 Accountability Jam (from itch.io). I didn't manage to finish the game, and, after entering this month's accountabilty jam (november 2025) I decided to take the concept of the previous month's idea into a new direction. It will be in the real world, either during 2025, the 90s, the 60s or the 50s. It will feature at least the city of Rio de Janeiro, my hometown.

# game concept
You need to make some money fast. You have a Bicycle. There is a courier/delivery service on your city that takes almost anyone. You do deliveries and get involved in a conspiracy/corruption plot in your city.

# game genre
Action/Adventure/Life Sim

# language / engine to be used
Godot or Python

# functional requisites

The player gets deliveries to do. And does them. Gets rewarded in money and experience. They're able to level up and buy better equipment that gives stats and/or skill boosts

There will be something similar to the SPECIAL system, maybe with less attributes. And skills also. The character can learn special moves on the bike by attaining certain benchmarks (e.g.: Level 5, or 7 Agility or 50 Bike-Riding). 

There will be mini side-quests to keep things interesting and give the game a semblance of a plot. They'll be optional. If you wanna do just deliveries forever you can (is this hard?, maybe an optional endless mode after the JAM game is done)

# non-functional requisites

~~It's a prequel fan-game for Fallout: New Vegas. You play as the Player Character from Fallout: New Vegas doing deliveries. You get a bike somehow, maybe in an abandoned factory, or some genius re-invents it. After the events of my game the bike will be lost forever an no-one will ever talk about it afterwards. That way it'll be lore friendly.~~

~~I think that it could be in-city deliveries. Maybe 3 or 4 major cities/settlements. From different factions. Our Courier has no allegiance. Something for local businesses or for people that want to buy from caravans and aren't able to leave their homes.~~

~~My game will literally end where Fallout: New Vegas begins. I have to decide what perspective it's gonna be made in (2D/3D/Isometric). And learn how to make the art for the assets. I'm not much of a designer.~~

(MAYBE) The main character lives in a cyberpunk Rio de Janeiro, on 2125. They need to make some money in a short amount of time. They decide to make deliveries using a bike. The tech is fallout-ish

# Additional Info about the main character. (source: [fallout.wiki](https://fallout.wiki/wiki/Courier)):

~~Before taking contract to deliver the Platinum Chip, the Courier had traveled across the former American Southwest, on the Long 15 to Primm, to Circle Junction, New Reno, Vault City, Fort Abandon and on Brahmin drives at the Big Circle.[1][2] They were also hired to deliver a package to a community near Death Valley, the technology contained within the package resulting in underground nuclear detonations after their departure, creating a hostile area known as the Divide.[3][4]~~

~~The Courier was one of six messengers hired by the Mojave Express at Mr. House's behest to deliver packages to the New Vegas Strip.[5][6] The Courier was carrying the only item of worth, House's Platinum Chip.[7] In order to steal the chip, Mr. House's protégé Benny intercepted the Courier, shot them in the head twice, and buried them in the Goodsprings Cemetery.[8][9][10][11] The Courier was dug out of their grave by Victor, a Securitron under Mr. House's control.[12] They were operated on by Doc Mitchell, the resident doctor of Goodsprings, who then monitored the Courier's recovery over the following days.[13][14]~~

~~Dialogue~~

~~The player character can make several statements about their past through in-game dialogue options. They do not form part of their background until they have been selected. Below is a list of elements of the character's past which can be learned through gameplay.~~
